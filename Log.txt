Work log of um optimization


1. Debug: since size 0 is possible, in unmapp segs, we have no invalid
indicator to use. We then dealloc the memory and use judge of NULL ptr in
other operations to see if segs are ummapped (instead of iterate through ummap
ids) TODO: performance test. (it is possibly worse)
2. Optimize usage of bitpack.c in parse_line.              2.67 -> 2.4
3. Move register index ra, rb, rc global. We intend to make compiler put them in
registers. If performance not changed, it means ra, rb, rc was already put in
regs. Then no more optimization possible. 
performance:
3.5. Remove opcode, but let parse_line return it and immediately used in switch.
So technically, one conversion between lvalve to rvalve can be reduced to speed
up. 
performance:
